Snake and Ladder by Nikko Gabriel J. Hisma√±a
-two players, one dice to roll
-displays 10x10 grid
-No input apart from pressing enter to roll dice
-bounce back rule: if player rolls beyond 100, they return, based on: https://www.ymimports.com/pages/how-to-play-snakes-and-ladders
-snake and ladders positions based on this photo: https://st.depositphotos.com/1508955/4164/v/950/depositphotos_41642213-stock-illustration-snakes-and-ladders-board-game.jpg
